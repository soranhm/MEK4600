MEK4600 â€“ Experimental Methods in Fluid Mechanics

## Course content
The course will provide an introduction to measurement methods relevant to experimental fluid mechanics. Knowledge of these topics will also be of use for fluid mechanics students involved in modelling. The course will provide an overview of analysis techniques commonly used in experimental work. Weekly exercises will provide reinforcement of the topics discussed in class. A variety of measurement methods and techniques will be presented in order to provide knowledge and understanding of common measurement methods used in research. Lab classes will provide the student with opportunities to apply the topics discussed in class to actual data. Literature which is relevant to the measurement techniques will be discussed in class as well.
